            <p>Hello!, My name is soufian boukir, 18 years old full stack developer,
                <br>I enjoy Creating things for the web. My interest in web developement 
                <br> was since 2021, I started with HTML & CSS as a markup languages.
                <br>
                <br>
                Then, I learn somthing about backend and how it work, So I started <br>
                with JavaScript then PHP, my first project was like facebook, but it just <br>
                designed, I don't programmed it yet, I build other projects, check <br>
                this <a href="html+css+js  projects" download>folder</a> to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                After that knowledge in web developement, I was interest to know <br> somthing 
                about websecurity and how we can protect our site from <br> hackers.
                So I have to search about that on youtube and free-platforms.<br> <br>
                I found a lot, but I just wanna tell you who was perfect for me. <br> <br>
                - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenewbaghdad">thenew baghdad</a> channel was help me to protect my websites such as <br>
                how SQL and XSS injections works and How we can protect our sites <br> from this injections. <br>
                - <a href="https://cybertalents.com/">cybertalents.com</a> is a platform who give some challenges in web security <br>
                and if you solve challenges you git points. <br>

                of the problem was on the challenge. <br>
                <br>
                So, this was a story how my career started on web developement.
